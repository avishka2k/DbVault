## Functionalities of the System

#### Create Tables:
This functionality enables administrators to create new tables in the ADBMS. In the context of Millennium, tables can be created to store information about students, courses, training schedules, financial transactions, and more. Each table defines the structure and organization of data, including the names and data types of columns.
#### Add Columns and Rows:
Users can add new columns to existing tables or add rows to store additional data. For example, if Millennium introduces new training programs, additional columns can be added to the respective tables to accommodate the specific program details. Similarly, new student records can be added by inserting rows.
#### Insert Data to Cells:
This functionality allows for the insertion of data into specific cells within the tables. In Millennium, this would involve populating the tables with details such as student names, contact information, course schedules, and financial records.
#### Delete Columns and Rows:
Users can delete columns or rows when they are no longer needed. For example, if a training program is discontinued, the associated columns and rows can be deleted to maintain a clean and relevant database.
#### Modify Columns and Rows:
This feature enables users to update or modify the data in columns and rows. In Millennium, this could involve changing student information, updating training schedules, or correcting errors in financial records.
#### Drop Tables:
Dropping tables means removing entire tables from the database. This function is typically used with caution, as it permanently deletes all data within the table. In the context of Millennium, it might be used to eliminate tables that are no longer relevant.
#### Adding Foreign Keys According to Relationships:
Establishing relationships between tables is crucial. Foreign keys are used to create these relationships. For example, foreign keys can link a student's record to a specific training program, ensuring that data remains connected and accurate.
#### Tracking Every Action in a Separate Table Using a Trigger:
To maintain a comprehensive audit trail, triggers are implemented. These triggers capture every action taken within the ADBMS, including table creation, data insertion, modification, and deletion. A separate table, often referred to as an audit or history table, records these actions, along with timestamps and user information
